Hi! I'm Megan.

My job is to help make Cloud infrastructure easier and more delightful to use.

I hear from users, forward feedback to product teams, build [tutorials](https://istiobyexample.dev), write [blog posts](/publications), and give [talks](/talks). I've been working with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) since 2016 (first at Cisco, now Google), focusing on multi-cluster use cases for edge computing and hybrid cloud. Now, I'm working on the developer experience for service mesh tools like [Istio](https://istio.io).

About me: I'm from Pennsylvania, and I live in New York City. I write fiction and [poetry](/poems), and also a weekly newsletter called [*spacebagels*](https://spacebagels.substack.com). I also love to play electric guitar, spend time outdoors, and read.

title: "A Kubernetes Developer Workflow for MacOS"

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) development is not one-size-fits-all. Maybe
you‚Äôre learning Kubernetes with
[Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) on your local machine; maybe
you‚Äôre part of a large organization with many clusters; maybe your cluster is an
on-prem lab, or lives in the cloud.

But whether you‚Äôre a cluster operator managing policies, an app developer
test-driving a new service, or a data scientist running
[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/kubeflow), chances are you are
doing some (or all) of: connecting to a cluster, inspecting its state, creating
resources, and debugging those resources.

As a [developer relations engineer](https://twitter.com/mo_keefe) for
Kubernetes, I work a lot with demo code, samples, and sandbox clusters. This can
get interesting to keep track of (read: total chaos). So in this post I‚Äôll show
some of the tools that make my Kubernetes life a lot better.

This environment can work no matter what flavor of Kubernetes you‚Äôre running,
and all these tools are made possible by the amazing open source community.

### üíª terminal

I use [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with the
[palenight](https://github.com/JonathanSpeek/palenight-iterm2) color scheme. On
top of that, I‚Äôm running [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) and
[oh_my_zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with the default
`robby-russell` theme.

This theme has basic Git support but is otherwise minimal. If you‚Äôre interested
in displaying your current Kubernetes context in your shell prompt, check out
[kube-ps1](https://github.com/jonmosco/kube-ps1) or the
[spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt#features) prompt.

Second, my `~/.zshrc` file has an essential line:

    source <(kubectl completion zsh)

This
[enables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#enabling-shell-autocompletion)
tab completion for kubectl commands. No more copy-pasting pod names!

### üõ∂ navigating clusters

On any given day, I might switch between three clusters. This might describe you
too! Do you get annoyed anytime you have to open your `kubeconfig`?Same!
Luckily, there is [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) for exactly this
purpose:

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vt7On1gLVnZyFKDScL-GJw.gif">


kubectx lets you navigate between cluster
[contexts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/#define-clusters-users-and-contexts)
easily. My favorite thing is running `kubectx -`, which takes you to the cluster
you were using last.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è superpowered kubectl

Now that we‚Äôve got a cluster to work with, let‚Äôs do stuff.

Maybe you‚Äôve felt that kubectl commands can get very long, with lots of
command-line flags. I have found that kubectl tab completion, plus a
comprehensive set of aliases (command shortcuts), helps a lot.

Here is a [great list of kubectl
aliases](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-aliases), that lets you run things
like:

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8j4WgwFfK_9wOHq5K2TUtg.png">
<span class="figcaption_hack">get pods</span>


<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*trS4MZoird8kgIaM618eig.png">
<span class="figcaption_hack">describe pod</span>

Finally, I use a few [kubectl
plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/). But
manually setting these up can get annoying. So I use
[krew](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew), [an open-source plugin
manager ](https://medium.com/@ahmetb/kubectl-plugin-management-21dcd93e3721)for
kubectl:


<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*1TjlIdS2DfKVabZ5ldCLCg.gif">

krew lets you browse, install, and use kubectl plugins, so that you can run
custom commands.

### üìú wrangling yaml

Now that we have a cluster ready to go, let‚Äôs deploy something.

Developing on Kubernetes means writing, managing, updating, and deploying lots
of YAML files. I keep all my YAML files in
[Git](https://github.com/m-okeefe/helloworld). Adopting
[GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) early (rather than
keeping files locally) lets me see revision history as I‚Äôm doing early
debugging, and sets me up for success later if/when I start formalizing a
pipeline for the application I‚Äôm working on. (example: a Github webhook for a
CI/CD pipeline.)

I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my text editor, plus the
[Moonlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atomiks.moonlight)
theme. And while VSCode has a ton of great features on its own, Red Hat‚Äôs [YAML
Suppor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)t
plugin is very handy for validation, autocompletion, and formatting.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ZGdvQwvn6_8WavC8L3XJ5Q.png">

Right now my process of writing Kubernetes YAML is fairly manual. But usually
for every new project, I‚Äôm writing the same Kubernetes specs: ConfigMap, Secret,
Volume, Deployment, Service.

I‚Äôm actively looking into ways to streamline this process, whether through text
editor extensions, [templating](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize),
or other tools. If you have tools that you use to help write and manage YAML,
comment down below! ‚¨áÔ∏è

### ‚ú® deploying

We have our YAML files. Now we can deploy the resources! Given my souped-up
`kubectl` environment, it‚Äôs tempting to do this manually.

But this can be a struggle road, dragging you into the same `docker build`,
`docker push`, `kubectl apply`, and`kubectl delete pod` commands. No fun.

A tool called [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) can automate away much of this
pain. skaffold is magical: it watches your codebase for changes. When you save
changes locally, skaffold will automatically docker build, push a new image tag,
and redeploy into your cluster.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rF-csS89udEJ6w-O9KFEbg.gif">

One really cool thing skaffold does is auto-generate image tags. So in your
actual YAML, you just list the image repo, not the tag, and skaffold will
populate the new tag(s) on deploy.

    spec:
      containers:
      - name: helloworld
        image:  gcr.io/megangcp/helloworld
        imagePullPolicy: Always
       ports:
         - containerPort: 8080

All that skaffold needs is a (yes, YAML) configuration file:

    apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta3
    kind: Config
    build:
      artifacts:
      - image: gcr.io/megangcp/helloworld
    deploy:
      kubectl:
        manifests:
          - kubernetes/*

This is a minimal config where I specify my image repo (in this case, in [Google
Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/), but any image
registry like [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) also works). I also specify
directory where my manifests live.

skaffold [is highly
customizable](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold/tree/master/examples),
and can work with deploy tools like Helm in addition to kubectl.

### üê≥ inspecting docker images

skaffold abstracts the docker build process, but sometimes I want to look into
my newly-built images to inspect things like: what is the image size compared to
previous versions? what are the contents of each of my image layers?

[dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) is an amazing tool for inspecting
Docker images.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zLIgc-0sHlfLAH0eJ06S6g.gif">

With dive, I can examine filesystem changes between different layers. This is
super helpful if something in my Docker build has gone wrong.

### üò± debugging

Now we‚Äôve got pods running Kubernetes. What next?

Every so often (read: all the time) something goes wrong ‚Äî with my spec, or with
my application code.

My kubernetes debugging workflow is usually:

1.  **Describe the pod** (`kdpo` alias). Is it my spec‚Äôs fault? (example: is the
Deployment trying to mount a Secret I accidentally put in a different
Namespace?) If not‚Ä¶
1.  **Get the pod logs**. the [skaffold
dev](https://skaffold.dev/docs/getting-started/#skaffold-dev-build-and-deploy-your-app-every-time-your-code-changes)
command will combine all the logs for every container deployed and stream all of
it to stdout. But I‚Äôve found that when I have two or more pods running, that
format gets noisy. At the same time, the usual `kubectl logs` command can result
in an endless cycle of copy-pasting new pod names.

[stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) is a great alternative for tailing
logs in a more customizable way. stern uses regular expressions to select on
pods ‚Äî and given that all pods start with their deployment name, you can follow
logs for all the pods in a deployment, without having to know the exact pod
name. Super helpful:

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WqZ3eEhhbt8Wau_G6DWDyQ.png">

If the logs aren‚Äôt giving me clues for what‚Äôs gone wrong, usually I‚Äôll‚Ä¶

3. **Exec into the pod** (`kex` alias with tab completion):
